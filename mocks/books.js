    description: 'Follow Chaol on his sweeping journey to a distant empire in this next instalment of the THRONE OF GLASS series by global #1 bestselling author Sarah J. Maas. Chaol Westfall has always defined himself by his unwavering loyalty, his strength, and his position as the Captain of the Guard. But all of that has changed since Aelin shattered the glass castle, since Chaol\'s men were slaughtered, since the King of Adarlan spared him from a killing blow, but left his body broken. Now he and Nesryn sail for Antica – the stronghold of the southern continent\'s mighty empire and of the legendary healers of the Torre Cesme. It\'s Chaol\'s one shot at recovery, and with war looming back home, Dorian and Aelin\'s survival could depend on Chaol and Nesryn convincing Antica\'s rulers to ally with them. But what they discover there will change them both – and be more vital to saving Erilea than they could have imagined.',
